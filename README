If you want to run this locally, you will need to install webpack and bundle the js files. 

I have it installed globally on my system, so I ran

    npm link webpack

Then I was able to run

    webpack

from the project directory.

You could also install it as a project dependency.

Also, in `webpack.config.js` file, you can change the mode to `'development'` if you want to step through and whatnot.

Enjoy!
